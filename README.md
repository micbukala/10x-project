# AI SciSum

AI SciSum is a web application designed to help scientists, students, and professionals quickly digest key information from scientific articles. Users can paste article text to receive automatically generated, structured summaries, or create and edit notes manually. All summaries are stored securely in user accounts for easy access, significantly reducing the time needed for literature analysis and improving research efficiency.
